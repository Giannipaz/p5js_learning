  Bees that go looking for food to bring home
    The bees move at different speeds and have different capacity
  When a bee delivers the food, it mates with the Queen Bee
    The Queen Bee reproduces with that bee. and has a fitness evaluation function.
    If that bee is the best at the moment, she stores that DNA info to create a better
    offspring (random new bees created 1-3). The lower the fitness in comparisson to
    the best one, the higher the chance to kill it. Also has a population cap.
